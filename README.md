Mac ADd COmmands Wsomething: Very simple, stupid, private & opinionated "package manager" for CLI tools on my macOS

CLI tools on macOS come from different sources: brew, cargo, npm, pip 2 & 3, go etc. 

I am tired of keeping track of where I got what. So I’ll have some premade lists of CLI commands, and sources where they come from. 

Then I want to do 

```
madcow i # install all
madcow u # update all
madcow c # clean all
madcow d # delete all
```

It’s opinionated because the premade list of CLI commands is mostly for work with graphics and text, including fonts, SVG, PNG, PDF etc.
